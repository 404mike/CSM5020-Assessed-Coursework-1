        <h1>The Importance and benefits of Responsive web design </h1>

        <h2>Market share</h2>
        <p>Website traffic from smartphones has increased 277% between 2002 and 2019 (broadbandsearch, 2019). It is estimated that by 2025; 72.6%, or 3.7 billion people, will access the internet from smartphones (Handley, 2019).</p>
        
        <p>Mohorovičić notes that 67% of users inclined to make a purchase on a mobile-friendly site (S. Mohorovičić, 2013, p. 1207).</p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>The advantage of having a responsive web design is that time is saved maintaining a single site (Meltem et al, 2013, p. 2277), along with a single set of content (Kim, 2013, p. 31), which means changes only have to be made in a single place (S. Mohorovičić, 2013, p. 1208).</p>
        
        <p>Responsive designs are also easier for users to navigate (Kim, 2013, p. 31), while making the content readable by not having to zoom compared to viewing a traditional desktop site (Meltem et al, 2013, p. 2277).</p>
        
        <p>Experiments undertaken by Hussain et al; found that users preferred using smartphones over Laptops in a number of metrics and tasks (Hussain and Mkpojiogu, 2015, p. 47).</p>
        
        <p>The use of break-points in responsive design allows for optimization for numerous device sizes. Designers are able to create pages that can scale from the smallest phone, to tablet and desktop monitors (Baker, 2014, p. 122).</p>
        
        <p>However, with smaller screens; horizontal scrolling should be avoided, as it takes users longer to understand how to navigate the site (Lestari et al, 2014, p. 59), as noted by Mohorovičić, smartphone users are five times more likely to leave a website if they are unable to complete their task (S. Mohorovičić, 2013, p. 1207). 
        <br />Users should be able to make sense of the information laid out on the page (Sutton, 2017, p.1).</p>
        
        <h2>Content fist</h2>
        <p>A content-first approach to web design should reduce distractions for the user and never overwhelm them with too many options (Shen, 2018). Krug notes that users spend most of their time on a webpage scanning the text in search of something (Krug, 2014, p. 39).</p>
        
        <p>To not overwhelm a user, the site should keep paragraphs short and have text formatted to allow visual scanning (Techved, 2018).</p> 
        
        <p>The use of images can help users understand the content on a page, as users are able to process images quickly (Julia et al., 2018, p. 20).</p>
        
        <p>The content on the page should be concise as users are unlikely to remain, or return, to a site if they are unable to find what they're looking for (Krug, 2014, p. 55). Chen et al, observe that trust is an essential factor in creating relationships with users (Cheng, Wu and Leiner, 2019, p. 396), users are more likely to return if they trust a website.</p>
        
        <p>Users of the site should not have to spend time working out which elements of the site are clickable or not (Krug, 2014, p. 15). The goal of the webpage is to be self-evident (Krug, 2014, p. 18).</p>
